# MalwareDART
A python malware detection, analysis and reverse ngineering toolkit( `MalwareDART``)
This is a Linux command-line interface (CLI) utility that use YARA , Capstone ,Redare2 among otheres to detect analyze and reverse engineer malware.
This is still a work in progress version, great things are underway.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/skye-cyber/MalwareDART.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd MalwareDART
   ```

3. Install the package:
   ```shell
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Usage

To run the CLI app, use the following command:

```shell
MDART [option]
```

Replace `[options]` with the appropriate command-line options.

## Available Options

- `-p/--path`:path to directory or file to scan
- `-v/--verbose`: Show all infor. By default screen clering is on so only one line of output show per time,
pass verbose to prevent screen cleaning.
verbose mode can be useful when work to e done is minimal

## Examples

1. Example command 1:

   ```shell
   MDART -p /home/user/Documents/
   ```

   ```shell
   MDART -p /home/user/Documents/ -v
   ```

  The toolkit will scan all the files and folder in the `/home/user/Documents/` directory and it's nested
  files and folders to the last child.
  `-p` also accepts file input

2. Scan working directory
   ```shell
   MDART
   ```
   ```shell
   MDART -v
   ```
Giving no option as in the above case, the toolkit will recursively scan the current directory (working directory)

## Adding rule(s) to the existing rules
```shell
MDART --add @foo
```
where ``@foo`` is the rule file, folder or even rule in text form

## Using exclusive rule
You may also want to rune scan using a given rule only, that case, you can follow this format
```shell
MDART --use @foo
```
where ``@foo`` is the rule file, folder or rule itself
